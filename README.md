Welcome to NetGuard, a robust web app developed as a collaborative effort during the __Web Safe Hackathon__ üåê. Our application is designed to enhance online safety by analyzing URLs for security threats and offensive content. By leveraging the power of Next.js, React, various external APIs, and Charts.js, we provide users with insightful, real-time analysis of the websites they visit.

## Features

- **URL Analysis**: Submit any URL to evaluate its safety in terms of security threats such as phishing, malware, and potentially harmful content.
- **Real-Time Data Visualization**: Interactive charts and graphs powered by [Chart.js](https://www.chartjs.org) offer a visual representation of the analysis, making it easy to understand.
- **API Integration**: Utilizes external APIs to fetch the latest data on URL safety and content categorization.
- **Responsive Design**: Built using [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) and [React](https://react.dev/), NetGuard offers a seamless experience across all devices.
